## PROCEDURAL LANGUAGE

It's like a procedure or well-structures steps to compose a program... Contains order of statements , functions , commands to complete a task...

## Example:

public class SimpleAddition {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Define two numbers to add
        int number1 = 5;
        int number2 = 7;
        
        // Calculate the sum
        int sum = number1 + number2;
        
        // Display the result
        System.out.println("The sum of " + number1 + " and " + number2 + " is: " + sum);
    }
}

## FUNCTIONAL LANGUAGE

It's like writing a program only in pure functions i.e. never modify variables, but only create new ones as an output.


## OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

It's about objects and classes
# code + data = object 
Developed to make it easier to develop, debug , reuse and maintain a software
