## Introduction

In computer science, stacks and queues are fundamental data structures that help us organize and manipulate data. They are like specialized containers for holding elements, each with its unique behavior. Let's dive into what these two data structures are all about.

## Stack

A **stack** is a data structure that follows the "Last-In, First-Out" (LIFO) principle. Imagine it like a stack of plates: you add plates to the top and remove them from the top. In a stack:

- **Push**: Adding an element to the top of the stack is called "push."
- **Pop**: Removing the top element from the stack is called "pop."

### Example
Imagine a stack of books. You add books one by one, and when you want to read one, you take the top book off. The last book you added will be the first one you read - that's LIFO!

## Queue

A **queue** is a data structure that follows the "First-In, First-Out" (FIFO) principle. Think of it like a line of people waiting for a bus: the person who arrived first gets on the bus first. In a queue:

- **Enqueue**: Adding an element to the back of the queue is called "enqueue."
- **Dequeue**: Removing the front element from the queue is called "dequeue."

### Example
Picture a queue of people at a ticket counter. The person who arrives first buys their ticket first and leaves the queue. The person who arrives later waits their turn, just like in a real-world queue - that's FIFO!

## Key Differences

- **Order**: Stack follows LIFO, while Queue follows FIFO.
- **Use Cases**: Stacks are great for tracking function calls, undo operations, or parsing expressions. Queues are ideal for task scheduling, handling requests, and breadth-first traversal.
- **Implementation**: Stacks can be implemented with arrays or linked lists. Queues can also be implemented with arrays or linked lists.

## When to Use

- Use a stack when you need to keep track of something and may need to undo or backtrack your steps.
- Use a queue when you want to process items in a strict order, like handling tasks in the order they're received.
